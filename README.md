Drowsiness is a state of near sleep, where the person has a strong desire for sleep. It has two distinct meanings, referring both to the usual state preceding falling asleep and the chronic condition referring to being in that state independent of a daily rhythm [16]. Sleepiness can be dangerous when performing tasks that require constant concentration, such as driving a vehicle. When a person is sufficiently fatigue while driving, they will experience drowsiness and this leads to increase the factor of road accident.

The project focuses on these objectives, which are:
•	To suggest ways to detect fatigue and drowsiness while driving.
•	Study on eyes and mouth from the video images of participants in the experiment of driving simulation that can be used as an indicator of fatigue and drowsiness.
•	To investigate the physical changes of fatigue and drowsiness.
•	To develop a system that use eyes closure and yawning as a way to detect fatigue and drowsiness.

Python:
We have used pythons 3.6 version which support OpenCV and packages for face recognition. Python is an interpreter, general purpose programming language. It is easy to understand.

OpenCV:
It is a library of many programming functions which is mainly used for real time computer vision program. 
      
Win sound:
If eyes are closed for more interval of time with the help of play sound application it will be able to play the alarm.

Threading and Time:
Library for handling threading and time operation.
